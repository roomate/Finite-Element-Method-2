# Finite Element Method: Analysis and approximation of PDEs

This repository stores the code of an introductory course to a non-conformal Finite Elements Method. Indeed, in the first repo 'Finite-Elements-Method' is presented the classical Galerkin method. The objective of this course was to introduce new techniques to the resolution of parabolic and elliptic PDEs. The term non-conformal signifies that the numerical solution is not admissible to the abstract variational problem, which is usually the case.

A simple way to observe this is the points of discontinuities at the interface of the finite elements, see below.
