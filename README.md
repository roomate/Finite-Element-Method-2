# Finite Element Method: Analysis and approximation of PDEs

This repository stores the code of an introductory course to a non-conformal Finite Elements Method. Indeed, in the first repo 'Finite-Elements-Method' is presented the classical Galerkin method. The objective of this course was to introduce new techniques to the resolution of parabolic and elliptic PDEs. The term non-conformal signifies that the numerical solution is not admissible to the abstract variational problem, which is usually the case.

A simple way to observe this is the points of discontinuities at the interface of the finite elements, see the figure in the right below. On the left is the numerical solution to Laplace equation in a square domain.
